# Security Model — UNO Card Game Server

This document describes the server-side security model for the UNO card game, focusing on information hiding, anti-cheat measures, and known limitations.

## Threat Model

### Game-Level Threats

**Adversary:** A malicious client that can:
- Send arbitrary messages to the server
- Inspect all data received from the server
- Attempt to infer hidden game state from public information

**Goal:** Prevent clients from gaining an unfair advantage by accessing hidden state (deck order, opponent hand contents, draw pile composition).

### HTTP Transport Threats

**Adversary:** Any HTTP client (not just game participants) that can:
- Send arbitrary HTTP requests to any Express endpoint
- Probe for information via headers, error messages, or timing
- Flood endpoints with requests (DoS)
- Submit oversized payloads to exhaust memory
- Exploit missing security headers for clickjacking or MIME sniffing

**Mitigations (applied via Express middleware in `server/src/middleware/index.ts`):**

| Layer | Mechanism | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Security headers | `helmet` | Sets `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`, etc. Prevents clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and protocol downgrade attacks. |
| CORS | `cors` | Allows cross-origin requests from any origin (game clients). In production, restrict to the deployed frontend domain. |
| Body size limit | `express.json({ limit: "16kb" })` | Rejects oversized JSON payloads before they reach application logic. Prevents memory exhaustion from large POST bodies. |
| Request logging | Pino logger middleware | Logs method and URL for every request. Aids incident response and abuse detection. |
| Rate limiting | `express-rate-limit` | Applied to `/metrics` and `/healthz` endpoints. Limits each IP to 60 requests per minute. Prevents scraping of Prometheus metrics and DoS of health checks. |
| Health check | `GET /healthz` | Returns `{ status: "ok" }`. Used by load balancers and orchestrators; rate-limited to prevent abuse. |

## Information Architecture

### Hidden State (Server-Only)

| Data | Storage | Client Visibility |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Draw pile card order | `UnoRoom.drawPile` (plain JS array) | **None** — not in schema |
| Opponent hand contents | `PlayerSchema.hand` (`view: true`) | **Self only** — StateView tag `-1` |
| Bot RNG seed/state | `Math.random()` | **None** — server-local |
| Bot difficulty setting | `UnoRoom.difficulty` | **None** — not in schema |
| Discarded card counts (hard mode) | `UnoRoom.discardedCounts` | **None** — not in schema |

### Public State (Visible to All Clients)

| Data | Schema Field | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Draw pile card count | `drawPileCount` | Count only, no card data |
| Discard pile contents | `discardPile` | All discarded cards visible (standard UNO) |
| Current player | `currentPlayer` | Seat index 0-3 |
| Play direction | `direction` | 1 or -1 |
| Active color | `activeColor` | Current playable color |
| Pending draw count | `pendingDraw` | Cards to draw on next turn |
| Winner | `winner` | -1 = none, 0-3 = winner seat |
| Game phase | `phase` | "waiting" / "playing" / "finished" |
| Hand counts | `handCount` (per player) | Card count for all players |
| Spectator count | `spectatorCount` | Number of spectators |
| Chat messages | `chatMessages` | Sanitized text |
| UNO caller | `unoCaller` | Seat that must call UNO |
| Rematch votes | `rematchVotes` | Seat indices that voted |

## StateView Mechanism

Colyseus `StateView` provides per-client field visibility:

1. **`PlayerSchema.hand`** is annotated with `view: true`, which sets a `-1` tag in the schema metadata.
2. When a human player joins, a `StateView` is created and assigned to `client.view`.
3. The player's own `PlayerSchema` instance is added to their view: `client.view.add(player)`.
4. The Colyseus sync layer uses this view to filter which fields are sent to each client.
5. **Only the player's own hand** is included in their view — opponents' hands are excluded.
6. **Spectators** receive no `StateView` and see only the raw schema (which already hides `hand` via the view tag).
7. **Bot players** have no client, so no `StateView` is ever created for them.

### View Lifecycle

- **Join:** `client.view = new StateView(); client.view.add(player);`
- **Card drawn:** `client.view.add(schemaCard)` — new cards must be explicitly added to the view
- **Leave:** `client.view = undefined;` — prevents memory leaks

## Known Information Leak Points

### 1. `lastDrawnCardId` (Severity: Low)

**What leaks:** The card ID of the card drawn this turn is visible to all clients.

**Impact:** Opponents know the identity of the drawn card (via its ID string), but this is limited to a single card per turn. In standard UNO, drawn cards are typically visible to the drawer anyway.

**Mitigation:** The drawn card is only locked in as "must play this card" — opponents cannot act on this information directly. The `DRAWN_CARD_ONLY` error is only sent to the active player.

### 2. `wildDraw4Illegal` (Severity: Low-Medium)

**What leaks:** When a Wild Draw 4 is played, all clients see whether it was illegal (player had a matching color card in hand).

**Impact:** This is intentional game mechanics — the Wild Draw 4 challenge rule requires this information for the challenge system. The value is set after the card is played and the turn advances.

**Mitigation:** The value is set server-side after `isWildDraw4Illegal()` checks the offender's hand. No client can request this value — it's published as part of the game state.

### 3. `handCount` (Severity: Very Low)

**What leaks:** Real-time hand size for all players is visible to everyone.

**Impact:** Standard UNO behavior — hand counts are always public knowledge. This allows opponents to track when a player is close to winning (1 card = UNO).

**Mitigation:** None needed — this is expected game behavior.

### 4. `discardPile` (Severity: None)

**What leaks:** All played cards are visible in the discard pile.

**Impact:** None — standard UNO rules require all players to see all played cards.

### 5. Bot vs. Human Timing Side-Channel (Severity: Very Low)

**The leak:** Bot turns are scheduled with a fixed delay from the moment
the previous turn ends. The delay is controlled by `BOT_TURN_DELAY_MS` in
`shared/constants.ts` (currently 3500ms). Human turns can take anywhere
from the moment a card is drawn (or played) up to
`HUMAN_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS` (7000ms), with the player taking action whenever
they decide — typically a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds.

A client observing the gap between "previous turn ended" and "next turn
started" can distinguish a bot from a human with high confidence:

- Gap close to `BOT_TURN_DELAY_MS` (3500ms) = next seat is a bot
- Gap shorter than ~500ms = next seat is a fast human
- Gap between 500ms and ~3s = next seat is a thinking human
- Gap near `HUMAN_TURN_TIMEOUT_MS` (7s) = next seat is an AFK human
  about to be auto-played

The information is also available via the `isBot` field on
`PlayerSchema` (which is public by design — players can see the avatar
label and the bot indicator in the UI), so the timing leak does not
reveal information that isn't already available. The timing channel is a
secondary, observational leak.

**Threat:** Low. A cheater could use this to identify bot opponents, but
this does not reveal hand contents, deck composition, or any other
hidden state. It only reveals seat occupancy type, which is also visible
in the lobby via the avatar/UI (`isBot: true` on `PlayerSchema`).

The threat does not include:

- Predicting which cards a bot will play (bot decision-making is
  unrelated to the delay — see the anti-cheat test on bot RNG
  isolation)
- Inferring hand sizes (already public via `handCount`)
- Inferring deck composition (deck order is server-side, not derived
  from the delay)

**Decision:** **ACCEPTED.** The leak is informational only and does not
enable any state-leakage attack. The mitigation cost is not justified
for this threat level.

**Future remediation (if threat changes):** If bot identification ever
becomes a real concern (e.g., a competitive mode where players want to
hide when they're queuing against bots), the mitigation options are:

- **Randomize the delay per turn** — `BOT_TURN_DELAY_MS ± 20%` would
  blur the bot-vs-fast-human boundary.
- **Schedule on a human-like distribution** — sample the bot turn
  delay from a distribution that overlaps with observed human
  turn times (e.g., a normal distribution centered at 2s with sigma
  1.5s, clamped to `[200ms, 7s]`).
- **Server-side turn pacing for all players** — pace all turns (human
  and bot) through a single server-side scheduler that releases turns
  at human-realistic intervals. This would also smooth out burst
  patterns in the matchmaker.

These mitigations are deliberately not applied today. The fixed delay
makes bot behavior more predictable for testing, and the threat
analysis above shows the leak is low-impact.

## Anti-Cheat Test Coverage

The `antiCheat.test.ts` file verifies:

1. **Draw pile isolation** — draw pile is not in schema, order not determinable from public state
2. **Opponent hand isolation** — StateView prevents cross-player hand visibility
3. **Known leak points** — documents which fields are intentionally public
4. **State snapshot comparison** — client view matches expected visible state
5. **Bot RNG isolation** — bot decisions not predictable, difficulty not exposed
6. **Card count conservation** — total cards (108) conserved across all state transitions

## Rate Limiting Configuration

### Application-Level (WebSocket Messages)

The `RateLimiter` class in `server/src/rateLimiter.ts` enforces per-player cooldowns on game actions:

| Message Type | Cooldown |
|-------------|----------|
| `play_card` | Configurable (default from `ACTION_COOLDOWN_MS`) |
| `draw_config` | Configurable (default from `ACTION_COOLDOWN_MS`) |
| `challenge_wild_draw4` | Configurable (default from `ACTION_COOLDOWN_MS`) |
| `chat` | 1000ms |
| `uno_call` | 500ms |
| `join` | 1000ms |

### HTTP-Level (Express Endpoints)

`express-rate-limit` protects `/metrics` and `/healthz`:
- **Window:** 60 seconds
- **Max requests:** 60 per IP per window
- Uses `RateLimit-*` standard headers (not legacy `X-RateLimit-*`)

## Recommendations for Future Hardening

1. **Consider masking `lastDrawnCardId`** — could be replaced with a boolean `hasDrawnCard` flag, with the actual card ID only sent to the active player via an encrypted message.

2. **Obfuscate `wildDraw4Illegal` timing** — the illegality flag is set immediately after the play; consider delaying the reveal until the challenge window closes.

3. **Add rate limiting per message type** — already implemented via `RateLimiter` class (see `security.test.ts`).

4. **Validate all client inputs** — already implemented via Zod schemas (`playCardSchema`, `chatSchema`) and manual validation in handlers.

5. **Sanitize chat content** — already implemented via `sanitizePlainText()` with DOMPurify-style stripping.

## Schema Annotations Reference

```typescript
// PlayerSchema — hand is private (view tag -1)
export const PlayerSchema = schema({
  sessionId: "string",        // public
  seatIndex: "number",        // public
  name: "string",             // public
  isBot: "boolean",           // public
  connected: "boolean",       // public
  hand: { array: UnoCardSchema, view: true },  // PRIVATE
  handCount: "number",        // public
});

// UnoRoomState — no view tags (all fields public or not in schema)
export const UnoRoomState = schema({
  players: { map: PlayerSchema },
  discardPile: { array: UnoCardSchema },
  drawPileCount: "number",    // count only
  // drawPile: NOT IN SCHEMA — server-only
  // difficulty: NOT IN SCHEMA — server-only
  // discardedCounts: NOT IN SCHEMA — server-only
  // ...
});
```
