## Epic 1 — Client Performance and Rendering  [~]

### 1.1 Consolidate card PNGs into a single sprite atlas  [x] (committed)
- [x] **1.1.1** Audit the current `kenney_playing-cards-pack/PNG/Cards
  (medium)/` directory — 137 PNGs found, all unreferenced.
- [x] **1.1.2** Confirm the sprite-sheet layout — 10×6 grid matching
  `ATLAS_ORDER` and the CSS background-position math.
- [x] **1.1.3** Provide a build script for future asset additions —
  `scripts/build-card-atlas.mjs` (ImageMagick `montage`-based).
- [x] **1.1.4** Atlas already wired up via `/cards/atlas.webp` and
  `card-sprite` CSS — no change needed.
- [x] **1.1.5** Verified: build clean, smoke test passes, no
  visual change.
- [x] **1.1.6** Measured: HTTP request count for cards was already 1
  (atlas only); the 137 PNGs were dead code. Repo: -1.3MB.
- [x] **1.1.7** Bonus finding: removed stale `list.txt` (pointed at
  `/home/gfunk/...`, different dev's machine).

### 1.2 Eliminate per-card re-renders in the table view  [~]
- [~] **1.2.1** Add a `why-did-you-render` style dev-only logger
  (or use React DevTools Profiler) and capture the current render
  rate on a typical 4-player game in progress. — Profiler numbers
  captured in `04d7a92` baseline measurements.
- [x] **1.2.2** Identify the top 3 hot paths in
  `useTableRoomController.ts` and `TableRoom.tsx`. — Identified in
  `6445404` analysis.
- [x] **1.2.3** Apply `React.memo` to `HandCardItem` and `TableCardAlert`
  with stable prop comparators. Wrap callback props in `useCallback`
  in the parent. (commit: `6445404`)
- [~] **1.2.4** Slice the Colyseus state subscriptions so a card-list
  re-render doesn't trigger an opponent-strip re-render and vice
  versa. — Partially addressed by `TurnTimerRing` refactor in
  `f4e78c8`; full subscription slicing remains open.
- [x] **1.2.5** Re-run the profiler. Render rate dropped (no React
  re-render per animation frame after `f4e78c8` DOM-mutation
  refactor). (commit: `f4e78c8`)
- [ ] **1.2.6** Add a Playwright (or the existing agent-browser
  smoke) assertion that FPS stays above 30 during a 4-player
  game in progress. Pin the threshold so future regressions fail.

### 1.3 Asset compression pass  [~]
- [x] **1.3.1** Add `oxipng` to the client `devDependencies` and a
  `prebuild` (or `pretest:smoke`) script that compresses PNGs in
  `web-react/public/`. (commit: `20f1664`)
- [x] **1.3.2** Run the compression on the existing card PNGs and
  the atlas from 1.1. Record the size delta in the commit message.
  (commit: `21558ab`)
- [~] **1.3.3** Verify the smoke test still passes (compressed
  images are pixel-identical to the originals). — Compression
  pipeline in place via `prebuild`; full smoke verification of the
  compressed assets is still open.
- [x] **1.3.4** Add a CI check (or local pre-commit hook) that
  fails if a new PNG lands without a compressed counterpart.
  (commit: see R3 in the remaining-work log)

## Epic 2 — Server Scalability and Architecture  [ ]

### 2.1 Matchmaking queue  [ ]
- [ ] **2.1.1** Read the Colyseus `MatchMaker` docs and decide:
  built-in `MatchMake` lobby room vs. custom `QueueRoom`.
- [ ] **2.1.2** Implement the queue. Wire it into `app.config.ts`
  so a client `matchmake` message hits it instead of the direct
  `uno` join.
- [ ] **2.1.3** Add a server test: two clients send `matchmake`,
  assert they end up in the same `UnoRoom`.
- [ ] **2.1.4** Add a server test: 4 clients send `matchmake`,
  assert they're grouped into one `UnoRoom` (not split across two).
- [ ] **2.1.5** Backward-compat: keep the direct `uno` join working
  for at least one release behind a feature flag.

### 2.2 Rate-limit expansion  [ ]
- [ ] **2.2.1** Audit the existing `ACTION_COOLDOWN_MS` usage.
  Map every message type → which rate-limit bucket it should hit.
- [ ] **2.2.2** Add per-message-type buckets: `play`, `draw`,
  `chat`, `uno_call`, `join`, `rematch_vote`. Use a single
  `RateLimiter` class with named buckets.
- [ ] **2.2.3** Add a structured error code (`RATE_LIMITED`) to
  the rate-limit response so clients can show a useful message.
- [ ] **2.2.4** Add server tests: send 5 chat messages in 100ms
  and assert the 5th is rejected with `RATE_LIMITED`. Same for
  UNO calls.

### 2.3 Redis presence documentation  [ ]
- [ ] **2.3.1** Write `docs/scaling.md`: topology diagram (ASCII
  is fine), env vars, the failure modes, what to watch for in
  production.
- [ ] **2.3.2** Add a runbook section to `incident-response/`
  for "Redis presence connection lost" — the symptoms, the
  immediate mitigation, the long-term fix.

### 2.4 StateView audit  [ ]
- [ ] **2.4.1** Read `UnoRoomState.ts`. Identify every field that
  is per-player-private (hands, votes, draw pile composition).
- [ ] **2.4.2** Audit the `onChange`/`onAdd` listeners. Assert
  the server filters state before broadcast, not the client.
- [ ] **2.4.3** Add a server test that proves a malicious client
  cannot reconstruct the deck from the broadcast state. Snapshot
  both server and client views, diff, assert only the public
  surface is shared.
- [ ] **2.4.4** Document the `StateView` policy in
  `docs/architecture.md` so future schema changes preserve it.

## Epic 3 — Observability and Monitoring  [ ]

### 3.1 Structured logger (Pino)  [ ]
- [ ] **3.1.1** Add `pino` and `pino-pretty` to `server/`
  devDeps. Replace the existing `logger.ts` implementation.
- [ ] **3.1.2** Wire the new logger into `UnoRoom`, `DemoRoom`,
  and the reconnection path. Existing log callsites should need
  minimal changes.
- [ ] **3.1.3** Configure JSON output in production (when
  `NODE_ENV=production`), pretty-print in dev. Document the
  config in `server/README.md`.
- [ ] **3.1.4** Add a server test that asserts log output is valid
  JSON when `NODE_ENV=production` and has the expected fields
  (timestamp, level, msg, ...).

### 3.2 `/metrics` endpoint  [ ]
- [ ] **3.2.1** Add `prom-client` to the server deps. Create a
  `metrics.ts` module with a `Registry` and the default Node
  process metrics enabled.
- [ ] **3.2.2** Add Colyseus-specific gauges: room count by
  name, active users (sessions), memory usage, game duration
  histogram.
- [ ] **3.2.3** Wire `GET /metrics` into the Express setup in
  `app.config.ts`. Make sure it doesn't fight with Colyseus's
  internal routes.
- [ ] **3.2.4** Add a server test: `GET /metrics` returns
  Prometheus text format, includes the expected metric names.
- [ ] **3.2.5** Add a rate limiter to `/metrics` (any of
  express-rate-limit or a custom one) so a malicious client
  can't scrape it into a DoS.

### 3.3 Sentry client integration  [ ]
- [ ] **3.3.1** Add `@sentry/react` to the client deps. Create
  `web-react/src/sentry.ts` that initializes Sentry from
  `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (or no-ops if unset).
- [ ] **3.3.2** Wrap the root render with Sentry's `ErrorBoundary`
  and add a `Sentry.init` call with the right `tracesSampleRate`
  for dev vs. production.
- [ ] **3.3.3** Add a test-mode flag that makes Sentry no-op
  in the smoke test (we don't want test errors going to a real
  Sentry project).
- [ ] **3.3.4** Add a vitest-style test that renders a
  deliberately-throwing component and asserts Sentry's
  `captureException` is called with the right context.

## Epic 4 — Quality Assurance and Security  [ ]

### 4.1 Full game-loop E2E tests  [ ]
- [ ] **4.1.1** Read the existing `scripts/smoke-web-agent-
  browser.sh`. Identify which game-loop steps it covers and
  which it doesn't.
- [ ] **4.1.2** Extend the smoke script to run a complete game
  with a human client + 3 bots: join, deal, play, draw, play,
  end, rematch. Capture the state at each step.
- [ ] **4.1.3** Add a test assertion: the game ends with exactly
  one winner, the `winner` field matches the player who played
  their last card, the other players' final hand counts add up
  to the deck math.
- [ ] **4.1.4** Run the test in CI. Make sure it gates merges.

### 4.2 Strict payload validation  [ ]
- [ ] **4.2.1** Pick the validator. Recommendation: `zod` (mature
  ecosystem, good TS interop, smaller bundle than alternatives).
  Add it to server deps.
- [ ] **4.2.2** Define a schema for every incoming Colyseus
  message type (`play_card`, `draw_card`, `chat`, `uno_call`,
  `rematch_vote`, etc.). Keep them in `server/src/schemas/`.
- [ ] **4.2.3** Wrap every message handler with the schema. On
  parse failure, send a `MESSAGE_REJECTED` error with the
  schema path that failed (so clients can show useful errors).
- [ ] **4.2.4** Add a fuzz test: throw 1000 random shapes at
  every message handler, assert none crash the room. Log the
  first 10 failures for debugging.
- [ ] **4.2.5** Document the schema files in
  `docs/protocol.md` (or a new `docs/message-schemas.md`).

### 4.3 Anti-cheat audit  [ ]
- [ ] **4.3.1** Identify the high-value hidden state: deck
  order, opponent card values, draw pile composition, internal
  bot RNG state. List it in `docs/security.md`.
- [ ] **4.3.2** Add a server test that compares the broadcast
  state (what a client sees) to the server's actual state. Fail
  on any field that leaks.
- [ ] **4.3.3** Audit the RNG: is the deck shuffle deterministic
  from the seed? Could a client replay past states to predict
  the next draw? Document the answer in `docs/security.md`.
- [ ] **4.3.4** Audit the bot: can a client tell which seats
  are bots vs. humans from timing? (Yes, probably. Document
  the leak and decide if it's a threat to fix.)

### 4.4 Middleware security  [ ]
- [ ] **4.4.1** Add `helmet` to the server deps. Configure it
  with the project's CSP (we serve an SPA, so the policy is
  fairly tight by default).
- [ ] **4.4.2** Add `cors` with an allow-list. Default to the
  deployment's known origins. Document the config in
  `docs/security.md`.
- [ ] **4.4.3** Add a body-size limit to the Colyseus transport
  (Colyseus has its own message size limits, but check).
- [ ] **4.4.4** Add a request logger middleware that logs
  method, path, status, duration. Use the Pino logger from 3.1.
- [ ] **4.4.5** Add a rate limiter on `/metrics` and `/healthz`
  (one we wired in 3.2.5) — make sure it survives under
  expected scrape rates but rejects bursts.
- [ ] **4.4.6** Document the threat model and the mitigations
  in `docs/security.md`.
