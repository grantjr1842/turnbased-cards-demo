## Remaining Work 🔨

### 🔴 Critical (must fix before commit)

- [x] **BUG: TypeScript error in UnoRoom.ts** — FIXED: Changed `chatMessages = []` to `chatMessages = new ArraySchema()` and added `ArraySchema` import from `@colyseus/schema`.
- [x] **Missing: server `build` script** — FIXED: Added `"build": "npx tsc --noEmit"` to server/package.json. Also added `typescript` as devDependency and created `tsconfig.build.json` for production builds.
- [x] **Production build approach** — FIXED: Updated deployment docs to use `npm start` (tsx runtime) instead of compiled dist/. The tsx runner handles TypeScript natively and is production-ready.

### 🟡 Pending (should do before calling "done")

- [x] **Commit all modified files** — All changes committed and pushed.
  - server/shared/constants.ts (new file)
  - server/src/logger.ts (new file)
  - server/src/rooms/UnoRoom.ts (major changes)
  - server/shared/uno.ts (major changes)
  - server/src/rooms/schema/UnoRoomState.ts (chatMessages, spectatorCount, unoCaller)
  - server/tsconfig.build.json (new file)
  - web-react/src/components/*.tsx (new components)
  - web-react/src/sound.ts (new file)
  - web-react/public/sw.js, manifest.json, favicon.svg (PWA)
  - .github/workflows/client.yml, server.yml (new files)
  - gamemaker/setup_project.sh (modified)
  - And many package-lock.json updates

- [x] **Verify GitHub Actions pass** — All CI workflows passing (Server CI, Client CI, Deploy).

- [x] **Browser smoke tests need server running** — CDP smoke checks validate lobby; full gameplay requires server which is documented.

### 🟢 Nice to Have (future enhancements) — ALL DONE

- [x] **Large chunk size warning** — Raised chunkSizeWarningLimit to 800 kB. Build clean.
- [x] **Redis adapter configuration** — Added `@colyseus/redis-presence` with `REDIS_URL`/`REDIS_HOST` env var support.
- [x] **Private room password** — Password input in lobby, server validates in onJoin.
- [x] **Bot difficulty selection UI** — ALREADY IMPLEMENTED (was stale in TODO).
- [x] **Mobile responsive design** — Added mobile media queries and swipe gestures.
- [x] **Leaderboard / stats** — localStorage-based stats with leaderboard overlay.
- [x] **Rematch voting** — Vote overlay when game ends, auto-restart on unanimous consent.

## Verified Audit Pass (2026-06-10)

A second-pass recursive audit was performed on the working tree (uncommitted
as of 2026-06-08) and committed on 2026-06-10. This was a **cleanup /
hardening** pass — not a feature pass. The full verified-fix list and the
re-run command log live in [`AUDIT_LOG.md`](./AUDIT_LOG.md) at the repository
root.

**Scope (39 files, +895 / −1287):**

- 30 files modified (server + web client)
- 9 files added: 2 src modules (`web-react/src/stateSnapshot.ts`,
  `web-react/src/storage.ts`), 6 test files, 1 audit log

**Categories of change:**

- **Type safety** — removed remaining `any` casts in `shared/gameLogic.ts`,
  `web-react/src/main.tsx`, `web-react/src/audio/sfx.ts`,
  `server/test/uno-room.test.ts`, `server/test/security.test.ts`.
- **Helper extraction (DRY)** — `populateSchemaCard`, `toSchemaCard`,
  `schemaHand`, `resetRoundActionState`, `createRoomWithHuman`, and the
  centralized `testClients.ts` mock-client helper.
- **Test coverage** — added `demo-room.test.ts` (lifecycle, replay, draw),
  `stateSnapshot.test.ts`, `sfx.test.ts`, `stats.test.ts`,
  `gameHelpers.test.ts`, plus reconnection coverage that replaced stubs.
- **Browser hardening** — `AudioContext` resume on user gesture, storage
  validation/trim/clamp, connect-generation guard to prevent stale
  `Room` handlers, PWA `serviceWorker` registration moved out of the
  `load` listener.
- **Server room correctness** — `UnoRoom` restart/rate-limit/rematch
  cleanup, `DemoRoom` lifecycle (no duplicate tick timers), wild color
  persistence, replay selector alignment with the shared strategy.
- **Dependency hygiene** — direct `@colyseus/core` (no umbrella `colyseus`),
  explicit `ws` dep, dropped playground/monitor middleware. `npm audit
  --omit=dev` clean on both server and client.

**Verification (run 2026-06-10 on the committed tree):**

| Check | Server | Web |
|---|---|---|
| Build | ✓ `npx tsc --noEmit` | ✓ tsc + vite (95 modules, 261KB main) |
| Tests | ✓ 143 / 143 | ✓ 19 / 19 (unit) |
| Lint | n/a | ✓ 0 errors, 0 warnings (oxlint) |
| Smoke | n/a | ✓ xvfb-run captured screenshots + video |
| `npm audit --omit=dev` | ✓ 0 vulns | ✓ 0 vulns |

**Production roadmap (`.gemini-plans/production-roadmap.md`)** — **COMPLETE.** All 4 epics (13 items total) have been implemented:

**Epic 1: Client Performance and Rendering (Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)**
- Consolidated card PNGs into a single sprite atlas (137 PNGs removed)
- Eliminated per-card re-renders in table view with React.memo and stable callbacks
- Added asset compression pass with oxipng and prebuild step

**Epic 2: Server Scalability and Architecture (Tasks 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)**
- Implemented matchmaking queue with Colyseus MatchMaker
- Expanded rate limiting to all message types (chat, UNO calls, join attempts)
- Documented Redis presence deployment in docs/scaling.md
- Completed StateView audit and documentation in docs/architecture.md

**Epic 3: Observability and Monitoring (Tasks 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)**
- Replaced logger with Pino structured logging (JSON in production, pretty in dev)
- Added /metrics endpoint with prom-client (room counts, users, memory, game duration)
- Integrated Sentry for client error tracking with test mode flag

**Epic 4: Quality Assurance and Security (Tasks 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4)**
- Extended E2E tests to run full game loops with bots + human client
- Added strict payload validation with zod schemas for all message handlers
- Completed anti-cheat audit (server state filtering, RNG analysis)
- Implemented middleware security (helmet, CORS, body size limits, request logging)
